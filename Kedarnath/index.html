            <h1>What is Kedarnath?</h1>
            <p>
                Kedarnath Temple (Sanskrit: केदारनाथ मंदिर, IAST: Kēdāranātha Mandira, lit 'temple of the God of the
                field') is a Hindu temple, one of the twelve jyotirlinga of Shiva. The temple is located on the Garhwal
                Himalayan range[citation needed] near the Mandakini river, in the state of Uttarakhand, India. Due to
                extreme weather conditions, the temple is open to the general public only between the months of April
                (Akshaya Tritiya) and November (Kartik Purnima, the autumn full moon). During the winters, the vigraha
                (deity) of the temple is carried down to Ukhimath to be worshipped for the next six months. Kedarnath is
                seen as a homogeneous form of Shiva, the 'Lord of Kedarkhand', the historical name of that particular
                region.
